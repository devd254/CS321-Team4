### Installation/Set-up
##### Download nodejs
Windows x64

https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.13.1/node-v20.13.1-x64.msi

MacOS x64

https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.13.1/node-v20.13.1.pkg

##### Clone repository

Use github desktop app (not sure how it works in there)

In terminal:

In location to clone repository: git clone https://github.com/devd254/CS321-Team4.git

##### Install packages & dependencies (will only work with node.js installed)
###### Navigate to "cs321-project" directory
npm install

##### Good to go!

create you're branch and get started :D

### Important Reminders
Probably only a concern if using git commands NOT app. When doing anything git related (pushing, pulling, etc.) ensure you are in the outermost directory (cs321-project should work). If in sub directories, certain changes you made MIGHT not be added/altered.

Make sure to pull from main and rebase your working branch regularly. IF YOU DON'T MERGE CONFLICTS WILL ARISE
##### How to rebase

1) Checkout to main branch 
2) pull from origin/remote main branch
3) checkout to your working branch
4) rebase from main

##### Running the webpage locally


###### Navigate to cs321-project directory, then in terminal

npm run dev
